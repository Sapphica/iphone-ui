### ***A custom iPhone OS rebuild — icons, lock screen, gestures, UI sounds, and real-time overlays.***

---

# 🎯 Project Info

## Purpose
To create a UI that looks like **glass**, features **animated backgrounds**, and makes iOS more intuitive and productive through a fully custom interface.

This system was built **14 years ago** — long before Apple introduced widgets, themes, dynamic wallpapers, lock-screen customization, or gesture-based navigation.  
Everything here predates the modern iOS customization era.

This project includes:

- Complete **system icon overhaul**
- **Text-to-speech** scripts for reading emails and messages
- **Real-time system monitoring** overlays
- **Web API + live weather** integrated into the lock screen
- Custom **gesture engine** (drag-out to close, flip-up dock — *years before Apple*)
- Multiple **full OS-level theme builds**
- True code-level modifications

> Only a **small portion** of the original system is published here.  
> Applet loaders, system patches, and core engine remain private.

# ✨ Highlights From the Complete Original Mod

- **Android-style flip-clock lock screen**, ported to iOS  
  with animated hot-air balloons and dynamic weather graphics.
- Fully themed **pink interface**: icons, dialer, messages, keyboard, and system chrome.
- **Voice-read email** (first 10 lines auto-spoken).
- **Audible dialer**, custom notification sounds, and a full UI soundscape.
- **Gesture rewrites**:
  - Drag-out-to-close  
  - Flip-up dock  
  - Custom overlays + transitions  
- **Power-menu overlay** (predating Control Center).
- Three full OS builds — this was a real interface rebuild, not a surface-level theme.

Only the archival-safe pieces are included here.
